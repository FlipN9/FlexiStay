# Welcome to FlexiStay!
FlexiStay is an online platform for short-term sublet rentals, designed to make it easy for users to find, book, and enjoy stays. Whether you're traveling for work, pleasure, or a little bit of both, FlexiStay has you covered.

## User-Friendly UI Design
Our single-page web application, built with React and AntD, provides a seamless and efficient user experience. You'll be able to quickly post, search, and book stays, all from one convenient place.

## Back-End Services
We've integrated robust back-end services to support our platform, including Java Spring Boot and MySQL with Hibernate for handling user data and stay information, as well as Google Cloud Storage for storing media files. With these powerful tools, you can be confident that your data is safe and secure.

## Token-Based User Authentication
At FlexiStay, we take security seriously. That's why we've implemented token-based user authentication on the server-side using the Spring Security framework. You can trust that your information is protected, so you can focus on enjoying your stay.

## Geo-Based Stay Search
FlexiStay makes it easy to find the perfect stay, no matter where you are. Our integration of geo-indexing with Elasticsearch allows for geo-based stay search, so you can quickly find stays near your location.

## Deployed on Google App Engine
For enhanced scalability and reliability, we've deployed FlexiStay on Google App Engine. You can be confident that our platform will be available when you need it, so you can focus on enjoying your stay.

We hope you'll enjoy using FlexiStay as much as we enjoyed building it! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to us.
